This is a free and open source project for a directory type site created for the NGO MEX VS COVID-19 who's vision is to support small and medium business around Mexico during the COVID-19 Pandemic. This site helps the different projects to get more exposure, as some of them don't even have a website.

You can check the live version of this project at [https://mexvscovid19.com/](https://mexvscovid19.com/) and please feel free to use it, fork it, and improve on in anyway you see fit. Pull requests encouoraged and accepted :).

Yes... that's it.
